# DataOrganizer

Organize your data (images) in the most efficient way possible.

By moving around with arrow keys and setting up your own custom hotkeys to do your own custom actions (currently three actions: Copy, Move and Delete), your data will be organized in no time!

# How to use

Select an image directory. Accepted file types are .png, .jpg and .jpeg

Create a list of actions with their hotkeys. When pressing a hotkey while selecting an image, the action corresponding to the key will be auto-saved with that image. The action will be shown at the bottom of the image. To move around the images, use the arrow keys. Finally, to perform all the actions, press on the "Confirm Action" button.

To make an action, first click "Listen" and press the hotkey. Then select the action you want (currently three actions: Copy, Move and Delete) and the directory if needed. Finally, click "Ok".

Save a list of actions by clicking on the "Save hotkeys" button. Load a list of pre-set list by pressing on the "Load hotkeys" button.
